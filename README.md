## JAVA

1. Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.
2. Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
3. Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.


### Applications of Java Programming

1. The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
2. The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.
3. Multithreaded − With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.
4. Interpreted − Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere.
5. High Performance − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
6. Distributed − Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
7. Dynamic − Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment.
